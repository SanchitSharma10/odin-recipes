    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Italian Tipo 00 Flour or Bread flour</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Basil (optional)</li>
        <li>Mozzarella</li>

    <ol>
        <li>First take whatever flour you have, and mix it with water. 75% hydration by weight, and mix in salt, sugar, active or instant dry yeast as well as some olive oil.</li>
        <li>Once this forms a dough ball you, can either knead it for 1-2 hours and put it away in a cold place, or straight away cover the dough, and put it in a cold area. The first method will allow you rise the dough under 14 hours whereas the second method will take atleast 14 hours if not more to rise the dough without knead.</li>
        <li>Once your dough ball has risen, take a piece and stretch it with hands onto the surace. Lift it once or twice in the air to let air into the dough so that it doesn't tear as much when forming the pizza</li>
        <li>Turn on ur stove and broiler. On the stove preheat your cast iron for atleast 5-10 minutes on high flame. When ready place the pizza dough you formed onto the cast iron. Quickly spread tomato sauce all over the exposed part of the surface, a long with mozzarella and optional basil if you have. Do a quick drip of oliveoil  around the the pizza and pop it into the broiler as close as you can get it safely.</li>
        <li>With stove off now and only broiler on, keep moving the cast iron handle (using oven mitts) from side to ensure even cooking. Take a look every so often to make sure the pizza does not burn on the top. It will be done when it looks like the image provided above. Serve and cut into 4 pieces and enjoy!</li>
